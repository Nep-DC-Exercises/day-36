# MVC and Express 

## Date: 10/17/19 W8 D4 D36

### Summary

Today we completed the demonstration of the MVC model using express by utilizing pg-promises and the async/await syntax to access data from our postgres database. We then used our route/controller to send data to our view. We were introduced to using the express application generator and installed it globally on our systems.

The `apple_ceos` folder contains files from the in-class code along. The `exercise` folder is my solo work as part of an exercise to create our own express app and access our own data from a new table. I decided to insert Arsenal FC First Team players into a table and display that information in an HTML Table.
